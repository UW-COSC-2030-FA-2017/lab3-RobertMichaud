    //as just "4", which shouldn't be a problem.  When double was used, the same was printed but
    //it only iterated up to "4.2".
    
    //Now, when using the higher ceilings for the iteration when using the float data type, the results
    //began to reach several more significant digits than just the two expected (ex. 9.39999 should be 9.4)
    //The reason for this is because we're using a floating point variable, which have small inaccuracies that
    //add up and eventually (quickly) become a problem.
